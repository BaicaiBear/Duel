## Overview

This mod introduces the Duel Necklace accessory.

Wear this necklace and fill it with enough stakes (default: diamonds, configurable) to activate it.

Your username will be displayed with the red "⚔" tag before and after it, and other players wearing the necklace will also have this tag.

Once equipped, you will switch to Adventure Mode (configurable).

When two players with necklaces duel, the loser will not drop items, but the winner can take 0–10 stakes (configurable) from the loser’s necklace.

As long as your necklace still contains stakes, you will respawn near your opponent upon death.

When your stakes are depleted, you will get one final death without item loss, but you will no longer respawn near your opponent.
